                <h2> Processed</h2>
                <p>Nyanja Fruit Growers are beginning to explore fruit processing as a way to add value to our product. Currently, we are drying mango using small scale solar driers. We are also producing honey as a bi-product.  Initial response iin the local markets has been positive and we plan to expand in this area of our business. Other products we are currently exploring include: dried banana chips, solar dried tomatoes, ......., ..... and .......... As with our fresh produce, our aim is to develop and expand into the regional and international markets.</p>
